 							Multinational giants like PepsiCo, Coca Cola, and Walmart, and 400 others, have set ambitious recycling goals under the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, started in 2018 by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The goal is a circular economy for plastic in which it never becomes waste; packaging is its first target. To that end companies have agreed to increase the amounts of recycled plastic used in packaging to an average of 25 percent by 2025, compared with the current global average of just 2 percent. That too is a big challenge, Alexander said.</p>

							<h4>	“To meet those goals we need 3.5 times more PET from what’s currently collected and sorted,” he says.</h4>
							<p>
							Plastic bottles are also made of PET and are the primary source for recyclers. An investment of at least $3 billion in processing plants alone will be needed over the next decade to achieve companies' goals, according to a report by research and analysis firm Wood Mackenzie. That doesn’t include additional investments in collection or improved material recovery facilities.

							National Geographic is committed to reducing plastics pollution. Learn more about our non-profit activities at natgeo.org/plastics. Learn what you can do to reduce your own single-use plastics, and take your pledge.
							Only 50 percent of U.S. household have curbside collection, so how do recyclers get their hands on the material, Alexander asks. Less than five percent of plastics in the U.S. is recycled. The rest is landfilled, burnt or exported. In 2017 two billion pounds of plastic waste were sent to China and Hong Kong, the same year China said it will no longer accept it.</p>

							<h4>“We need a sweeping discussion in this country on how to solve this problem,” says Alexander.</h4>
							<p>
							Recycling aside, the reusability of the clamshell is what Lunsford, its inventor, claimed was its advantage over existing plastic packaging. But there in the store, I had a thick plastic heat-sealed clamshell in my hand, with a pair of $3 scissors securely trapped inside. They were sturdy scissors, good enough to open all manner of packages. But like Larry David did, I would have to destroy the package to get them out, rendering the clamshell worthless. Were they worth the effort and risk to somehow free them from their plastic prison?

							I put them back on the shelf.

 					</div>
 					<div class="infortext">
 						<img src="image/hinharticle/ran2.png">
 						<p>
 							This is true of the mock viper, which has the triangular head, cryptic colour pattern and enlarged front teeth of its lethal relation. But it also appears to have gone a step further and evolved to change the shape of its rounded pupils into the vertical slits typical of a venomous viper when attacked.

Strine’s team was intrigued by the event and wanted to see it again. So, over the last four years of a biodiversity project in Thailand, they captured 36 individuals showing this behaviour.</p>

							<h4>	“I would love to look at this behaviour in a controlled lab setting because it may be that the behaviour has limitations based on aggressor species, stimuli and other environmental factors,” Strine says.</h4>
							<p>
							One question is whether it evolved as part of the snake’s elaborate mimicry. “We are not even sure if it is a defensive strategy or just something that happens when the viper is gripped,” Strine says.

Another possibility is that vertical pupils appear less conspicuous, helping the snake obscure the outline of its head. Or it could be that constricting its pupils improves the mock viper’s vision, so increasing the accuracy of its defensive strike.</p>

							<h4>“I would love to look at this behaviour in a controlled lab setting because it may be that the behaviour has limitations based on aggressor species, stimuli and other environmental factors,” Strine says.</h4>

 						<img src="image/hinharticle/kangaro2.png">
 						<p>
 							In fact, Australia’s kangaroo industry is one of the best-managed wildlife harvests in the world. It stands out for three reasons.

First, it is based on a sound understanding of the ecology of kangaroos, in particular the way their populations fluctuate in Australia’s variable climate. The harvest is regulated on the basis of CSIRO-led research that developed robust models of kangaroo population dynamics, and used them to simulate effects of harvest on long-term abundance. Many studies have since extended this knowledge and measured the impacts of harvesting.</p>

							<h4>	“I’ve never seen them in town like this,” says George Wilson, a professorial ecologist who’s been studying kangaroos for five decades. “I wonder if they’re someone’s pets.”</h4>
							<p>
							Second, the harvest strategy is appropriate for variable environments and robust to uncertainty. Many harvests of wild populations use fixed quotas, meaning that if the population declines the relative impact of the harvest increases, which can rapidly drive abundance to dangerously low levels.

In contrast, the kangaroo quota is adjusted each year to represent a constant proportion (10-20%) of population size. If abundance falls, so does the harvest quota.</p>

							<h4>“I would love to look at this behaviour in a controlled lab setting because it may be that the behaviour has limitations based on aggressor species, stimuli and other environmental factors,” Strine says.</h4>
							<p>
								
								We welcome the concern for Australian wildlife expressed by opponents of the commercial kangaroo harvest. However, it is misplaced and misleading. Biodiversity conservation would be better served if that concern were directed to the plight of the many Australian species that really are in trouble.

 						<h3>"Alaskan glaciers melting 100 times faster than previously thought"</h3>
 						
 						
 					</div>
 					<div class="infortext4">
 						<img src="image/hinharticle/gaubaccuc.png">
 						<p>
 							A NEW WAY of measuring how some glaciers melt below the surface of the water has uncovered a surprising realization: Some glaciers are melting a hundred times faster than scientists thought they were.

In a new study published today in Science, a team of oceanographers and glaciologists unpeeled a new layer of understanding of tidewater glaciers—glaciers that end in the ocean—and their dynamic processes.</p>

							<h4>	“They’ve really discovered that the melt that’s happening is fairly dramatically different from some of the assumptions we’ve had,” says Twila Moon, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado-Boulder who was uninvolved with the study.</h4>
							<p>
							Some of this calving and glacial melt is a normal process that glaciers undergo during seasonal transitions from winter to summer, and even through the summer. But a warming climate accelerates glacier melting across the globe, potentially through melting across the surface of the glacier, but also through underwater melting.

Glaciers can extend hundreds of feet below the surface, explained Ellyn Enderlin, a glaciologist at Boise State University who was not involved with the study. Finding higher rates of submarine melting tells us that “glaciers are a lot more sensitive to ocean change than we’ve even thought.” Understanding the melting processes and calculating the amount of melt accurately is essential for planning for sea level rise.</p>

							<h4>“We are just super jazzed that we can even do this,” says lead author David Sutherland, an oceanographer at the University of Oregon. “We weren’t 100 percent sure it was going to work.”</h4>
							<p>
							Monitoring specific glaciers for a long period of time can give researchers—and high school students—an idea of climate change-induced melting. Students at Petersburg High School near LeConte Bay started collecting data about the position of the glacier’s terminus in 1983. Their noting of the glacier’s retreat several years ago alerted scientists at the University of Alaska Southeast, piquing interest in better understanding melting at the glacier.

 					</div>
					<div class="infortext4">
 						<img src="image/hinharticle/haily2.png">
 						<p>
 							The researchers then used newer, high-resolution satellite images to verify the presence of beaver ponds. Available aerial photographs taken before 1999 didn’t pick up any signs of beaver activity in the area, Tape says. Kirk notes that beavers were present in the Lower Noatak River watershed before 1999, but in vastly smaller numbers than they are today.

Based on the images at hand, the researchers found 56 new complexes of beaver ponds in the area over the 16-year study period. On average, beavers expanded their range about 8 kilometers per year, Tape and colleagues reported in the October Global Change Biology.</p>

							<h4>	“This is remarkable, but it shouldn’t come as a surprise,” Tape says. “Beavers are engineers that work every day, all summer long.”</h4>
							<p>
							The animals have also made their way into western Alaska’s Seward Peninsula and the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, mountains that stretch east to west across northern Alaska, the researchers found. If the animals’ recent rate of expansion continues, beavers could spread throughout Alaska’s North Slope in the next 20 to 40 years, the researchers say.</p>

							<h4>“I never expected to see beavers on the tundra,” Roth says, intrigued by Tape’s team’s findings.</h4>
							<p>
							The beavers are not only persisting on the tundra, they’re thriving. The moderately sized streams and flat terrain provide ideal habitat. And once they gain a foothold, these industrious creatures set about making improvements that are probably an overall plus for myriad other species, Tape says.

For instance, frigid conditions in the region cause shallow streams to freeze solid in winter. But when a beaver builds a dam, the water that gathers upstream of the structure becomes deep enough to remain liquid below a sheet of ice that provides insulation from the chilly winter air.
